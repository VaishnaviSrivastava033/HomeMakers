MaaSiRasoi (MOMSY) is a unique platform designed to empower Indian homemaking moms by providing them a path toward financial independence through their culinary skills. At the same time, it caters to the needs of hostellers, students, and working professionals who crave the comfort and nutrition of homemade meals while living away from home.

This initiative builds a bridge between two essential communities:

🏠 Moms who are experts in home-style cooking are looking for ways to support their families financially from home.

🧑‍💼 Users like college students, bachelor employees, and long-term tenants who miss traditional, healthy, hygienic home-cooked food.

The platform creates a win-win ecosystem, where:

Homemakers become micro-entrepreneurs, showcasing their cooking talents.

Users get access to affordable, tasty, and authentic homemade meals prepared with love.
